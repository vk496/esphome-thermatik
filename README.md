## 📦 Installation

1. Ensure you have a working ESPHome environment.
2. Add the following snippet to your ESPHome configuration:

```yaml
packages:
  thermatik:
    url: https://github.com/vk496/esphome-thermatik
    ref: v1.0.0 # Check in https://github.com/vk496/esphome-thermatik/releases
    files:
      - path: package.yaml
        vars:
          mac_address: "3C:E0:64:XX:XX:XX"
          # pincode: 000000 # Not required unless you changed it from default
```

- Replace `mac_address` with the MAC address of your S-Thermatik NEO controller.
- Add `pincode` if your device requires a different from the default.

3. Compile and flash your ESP device with ESPHome.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- An device running ESPHome that supports BLE.

---

## 🛠️ Usage
Once flashed:
- ESPHome will connect to the S-Thermatik NEO controller via BLE.
- Sensor data and controls will be exposed through MQTT.
- Home Assistant will automatically discover entities if MQTT discovery is enabled.

---

## 📚 Notes
- A reboot of the ESP device is delayed 10s so the official app can connect first if needed.
- For advanced customization, you can edit `package.yaml` directly in your ESPHome configuration with extension and overriding.
- The status of the project is in early stages; use at your own risk and report any issues you encounter.
